- [nexar challenge #1](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/recognizing-traffic-lights-with-deep-learning-23dae23287cc) This is a classifier, no bounding boxes!
<br>Nexar provided 18,659 labeled images as training data. Each image was labeled with one of the three classes mentioned above (no traffic light / red / green). The final classifier achieved an accuracy of 94.955% on Nexar’s test set, with a model size of ~7.84 MB. [Github](https://github.com/davidbrai/deep-learning-traffic-lights)

### [Training object detection with Tensorflow](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/tracking-the-millenium-falcon-with-tensorflow-c8c86419225e)
A complete guide how to create your own object detector. 200–300 examples of each object is enough. There are plenty of annotation tools out there, such as labelImg and RectLabel. I used RectLabel, but it’s only for macOS. It’s still a lot of work, trust me. It took me about three or four hours of nonstop work to annotate my entire dataset.
